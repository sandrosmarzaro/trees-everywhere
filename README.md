## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandrosmarzaro/trees-everywhere.git
cd trees-everywhere
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root with the database credentials expected by `docker-compose.yml`:

```env
DB_NAME=trees_everywhere
DB_USER=trees
DB_PASSWORD=trees
```

Feel free to use any valuesâ€”just keep them in sync with your environment.

### 3. Build and start the containers

```bash
docker compose build        # one-time image build
docker compose up -d        # start app & database in the background
```

The API will be reachable at http://localhost:8000 when the containers are healthy.

### 4. Apply database migrations

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate
```

(Optional) create an admin account:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Run the tests

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py test
```

### 6. API documentation

The project ships with interactive, auto-generated OpenAPI documentation powered by [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/):

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/schema/` | Raw OpenAPI 3 schema (JSON or YAML, depending on `Accept` header) |
| `/api/schema/swagger-ui/` | Swagger-UI explorer |
| `/api/schema/redoc/` | ReDoc static documentation |

These routes are served as soon as the application container is running.
